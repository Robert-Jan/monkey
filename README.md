This repository contains the source code of the books by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).

### Interpreter
In the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" we build a programming language from scratch. We start with 0 lines of code and end up with a fully working interpreter for the Monkey programming language. We build the lexer, the parser, the AST, the object system, and the evaluator ‚Äî written with tests first and without 3rd-party libraries. This book is not about theory, its focus is runnable, working code.

### Compiler
"Writing A Compiler In Go" is the sequel to _Writing An Interpreter In Go_ and contains the next step in the evolution of the Monkey programming language: we're switching out the tree-walking evaluator for a **bytecode compiler and virtual machine**. It starts where the first book ends, uses the same codebase and follows the same approach: working code front and center, written from the ground up, tested and runnable.
